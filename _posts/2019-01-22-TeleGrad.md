A Telegram bot to monitor and control deep learning experiments.
DL training processes can run for many hours/days, and not always you are near your station to see how it's progressing or to make adjustments.

Using this Telegram bot I have built you can seamlessly get constant updates and even control your training process.

Works with both Keras and TensorFlow (with Keras, all you need is to include a dedicated callback).

Using this bot, you can:
- Get per epoch updates on the loss, accuracy etc.
- Change the learning rate
- Get loss convergence plots
- Kill the training process
- Query the latest LR or metrics
- Limit access to a specific Telegram user id
